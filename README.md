1. Introduction
Serliz Media Studio ("we," "our," "us," or "the Application") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our desktop application.

2. Information We Do Not Collect
We want to be perfectly clear about what we do not do. This Application does not:

Collect personal information: We do not ask for, receive, or store your name, email address, location, or any other personally identifiable information.

Track your activity: We do not monitor, log, or analyze how you use the Application.

Access your files without permission: All processing is initiated directly by you, the user.

Transmit data to our servers: All processing occurs locally on your device.

Use cookies or tracking technologies: The Application does not implement any form of user tracking.

3. Local Processing
All processing performed by Serliz Media Studio happens locally on your device:

Audio/Video Processing: Any media files you select for processing are handled entirely on your computer's hardware. The files are not uploaded to any external server.

Text Processing: Any text you input or that is generated from your media (such as transcripts) remains on your device.

Storage: All files, including originals and outputs, are saved only to the storage locations you explicitly choose.

4. Third-Party Services
The Application is self-contained and does not rely on external online services for its core functionality. The only potential external interaction would be if you, the user, manually choose to copy a generated transcript or translation into another application.
